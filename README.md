## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your credentials
- The Gmail App Password is specific to this application and can be revoked at any time
- The server uses CORS and runs on a different port than the frontend
- Email credentials are only stored on the backend for security

## Troubleshooting

1. If the server fails to start:
   - Check if port 3001 is already in use
   - Verify your email credentials in `.env`
   - Ensure your Gmail account has IMAP enabled

2. If email fetching fails:
   - Verify your App Password is correct
   - Check if your Gmail account has 2FA enabled
   - Ensure you have an active internet connection

3. If weather data isn't showing:
   - Verify your OpenWeatherMap API key
   - Check if you've exceeded the API rate limits
   - Ensure the location name is valid

4. If the AI assistant is not responding:
   - Verify Ollama is running (`ollama ps`)
   - Check if the claude model is installed (`ollama list`)
   - Try restarting the Ollama service
   - Ensure you have enough system resources available
